# My Portfolio

![Image of Header](assets/images/portfolioSS.png)


**8/9/18** This is my most current portfolio. I created it using advanced *CSS* techniques as well as using many font and icon libraries from around the internet (**Google Fonts**, **Font-Awesome**, **Adobe TypeKit**). While I keep it as up to date as possible it is not complete and likely never will be, as long as I keep honing my programming skills. At the time of this README it is not yet mobile responsive and I have plans to implement JavaScript functionality.
