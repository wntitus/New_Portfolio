    <div class = "bioBox"><p class = "bio">I'm a 23 year old currently attending the UCF Coding Bootcamp in Orlando, FL. I've lived in Orlando for about 10 years now, and while it gets a little too hot and a little too windy sometimes, I can't say that I've hated it. I've previously worked at Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, and Starbucks, honing my team building chops before finally deciding to pursue a career in something I've wanted to do for a long time now: coding. I'm super excited to take this journey and I hope you'll stick around to see what I'm going to come up with not only in the next few months, but in the years to come!</p></div>
